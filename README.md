# Stupid Balls

A 3D WebGL-based game with a physics engine and stupid rules

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a physical simulation game where the user throw balls at a particular speed and angle,
and must perform certain tasks (_e.g._, making 10 glasses fall) using as few balls as possible. 

The system must provide :
* A physics engine
* A WebGL 3D render and a 3D playground scene
* A mecanism for the user to throw balls in the desired direction and with a the desired force
* A set of "worlds" and associated "tasks", with increasing level of difficulty
* A mecanism to detect failure or success for the current task
